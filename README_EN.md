A local-first Chrome extension and Node.js service that saves rendered content from Chinese knowledge platforms to an Obsidian vault as structured Markdown.

![Select one rendered answer before saving](assets/screenshots/popup-select-answer.png)

## Why this project

- Save one selected answer or all currently visible candidates.
- Preserve title, author, source URL, and rendered body content.
- Link authors with Obsidian `[[internal links]]`.
- Route each supported source to its own vault folder.
- Keep captured content on the user's computer.

## Supported sources

| Source | Supported pages | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Zhihu | Question answers and column articles | Select one answer or save all visible answers |
| Caixin | Opened and rendered article pages | Does not bypass subscriptions or access controls |
| Zsxq | Visible topics and already displayed comments | Comments are not saved by default |

The extension reads only content that is already rendered in the current browser tab. It does not read site cookies, call private site APIs, simulate login, or bypass paywalls.

## Architecture

```text
Rendered page in Chrome
  -> Manifest V3 content script
  -> POST http://127.0.0.1:3721/save
  -> Local Express and Turndown service
  -> Markdown file in the local Obsidian vault
```

The service listens only on `127.0.0.1`.

## Quick start

Requirements: Node.js 20.19.0 or later and a Chromium browser with Manifest V3 support.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wanghaha1997/chinese-web-to-obsidian.git
cd chinese-web-to-obsidian
npm install
cp config.example.json config.json
```

Edit `config.json` and set `vaultPath` to the absolute path of your Obsidian vault:

```json
{
  "vaultPath": "/Users/your-name/Documents/ObsidianVault",
  "saveFolder": "Web Clippings",
  "sourceFolders": {
    "zhihu": "Zhihu",
    "caixin": "Caixin",
    "zsxq": "Zsxq"
  }
}
```

Start the local service:

```bash
npm start
```

Verify it:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3721/health
```

Then open `chrome://extensions/`, enable Developer mode, choose **Load unpacked**, and select the `extension` directory.

## Privacy

Captured content is sent only to the local service at `127.0.0.1:3721` and written to the configured vault. The project does not include analytics, cloud storage, user accounts, or AI summarization. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

When a supported website changes its DOM, use small sanitized HTML fixtures in extraction tests. Never commit cookies, credentials, paid article bodies, personal vault paths, or private user content.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md), and [Maintaining with Codex](docs/MAINTAINING_WITH_CODEX.md).

## Scope boundaries

This project does not provide account login, cloud sync, bulk collection through private APIs, paywall bypassing, or automatic AI rewriting. It only saves content the user can already see in the current tab.
